This can be the usual core classes (Fighter, Rogue, Archer, Mage, or  Cleric), crafting classes (Alchemist, Blacksmith, Chef), or something else entirely (Commoner,  Fisherman, Merchant, or noble/royal if you arrive in the jump as nobility/royalty). However,  Jobs can evolve into other jobs if certain requirements are met (Such as being mastered). Also,  you can switch between jobs that you have unlocked.  \nTitles: These are a bit like jobs, but they are always on and they can be unlocked by  accomplishing something or reaching a certain requirement, obtaining a title can grant you  skills and some titles have passive effects, which help you or make things more difficult for you.  \nSkills: These are things that you can do or abilities you have. Skills can be passive skills which  are always on (For example Fire Resistance) or active skills which you need to activate manually  (For example Bind).\nQuest Log: A menu that will inform you when have been given a quest and will show you what  actions you have taken so far, and what information is relevant to the Quest, and in some  special cases it will bestow you some form of reward upon the quest completion such as points,  money, items, or in some very rare and special cases jobs.  \nInventory. access to an anchored pocket dimension that travels with you. Its maximum capacity  is 400 items though some items can be “stacked” such as having two health potions would be  shown as having “health potion x2”.  \nParty Composition: This allows you to invite people to join your group and share experience  points. The benefit is gone when they leave the party or if you dismiss them.  \nShop: Well, this one speaks for itself, you can open a menu where you can use money to  purchase things. There is also a special version of this called the Skill Shop which allows you to  spend Skill Points to purchase Skills.  \nStatus: This is a menu that will show you information about yourself, including your Name, Sex,  Age, Current Level, Current HP, Current MP, Current Job, Titles, Stats, Skills, and Status  Ailments. It also shows how many people are in your party. You can choose to show your status  to others as well as decide who can see them and who cannot.

Heights can range from half a meter to three meters with proportionate weight between twenty five kilos and five hundred kilos and sufficient strength to move normally. This change can make you as attractive as the most attractive model wearing the most skillfully applied makeup, but does not confer any supernatural benefits.\n\nPhysical Health Refinement (free for all): You are cured of any physical and genetic issues and will not suffer from many common issues, such as cancer, as you age. You also gain the ability to render yourself fertile or infertile at will. You may choose to stop or start any menstrual or breeding cycle at will.\n\nPhysical Prowess Refinement (free for all): If below that level, your health and fitness increases to that of an average active, healthy person in their prime. Your physical fitness level will not deteriorate over time or through disuse, as long as your basic needs are met. You can perform at approximately half of peak human performance as described in the Notes section.\n\nMental Health Refinement (free for all): If below that level, your mental health increases to that of an average person in sound mental health. You are resistant (but not immune) to developing issues such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression. You do not have issues with self-motivation or the general mental fatigue that living for centuries may cause.\n\nMental Awareness Refinement (free for all): By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of any mental illnesses or other issues that you are suffering from. While this does not automatically remove those issues, it does tell you how to best deal with them, making therapy dramatically more efficient and providing a degree of leverage in coping with them.\n\nSpiritual Awareness Refinement (free for all): By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of the state of your own soul, including any outside influences upon it or damage it has suffered. If all or part of your soul is no longer in your possession, you also gain a vague idea of where it is located and who is currently holding it. This does not allow for removal of those influences, but it does give you an idea of where to start.\n\nSpiritual Resource Refinement (free for all): You may use all forms of non-physical energy interchangeably, effectively removing your need to track resources for individual types of powers. Whether this means that you can cast spells using chakra, perform martial arts using psionic power points, or some other combination is up to you.\n\nSecondary Powers Refinement (free for all): You automatically gain any ‘secondary powers’ required for your other powers to function. For instance, if you have a power that lets you run at supersonic speeds, you automatically gain a secondary power that keeps you from tearing yourself apart while using it.

If you have another interface of this nature, they will merge together seamlessly. Unlike other perks in this document, this perk is not chosen by the Jumper. Instead, the Benefactor selects whether this perk is used and which features are enabled. At the Benefactor’s discretion, some or all of these options may be available to Companions as well as the Jumper. Some common options include:\n\nThe Character Sheet: Pull up your current character sheet. It has helpful information on all of the mechanical information that you are aware of. Typically, this includes Perks, Powers, and Items that have been purchased with CP, Companions and their general status (in-jump, dead, alive, etc.), and drawbacks. This sheet never displays information hidden from the Jumper because of Drawbacks.\n\nThe Status Window: A small window that tells Jumper their current physical status. How descriptive and useful this is can vary wildly. In the best case, it’s a detailed accounting of injuries, status conditions, and other effects the character is under. In the worst case, it’s a little outline of the Jumper that glows in a color from green to red to show where injuries are (or black if something has been severed).\n\nThe Party Window: A window that gives the Jumper a listing of their active and inactive companions. The exact amount of information on the window can vary, but usually includes a status indicator of some sort (see Status Window, above) and may include things like mood, location, and access to their own character sheets.\n\nThe Quest Window: Does your benefactor have a list of tasks for you on this Jump? Is there something you have to do to resolve the plot so you can move on? This will keep a handy list of those things. It may or may not display progress toward your goals.\n\nThe Timer Window: A simple timer window that tells the Jumper how long they have left until their next jump. May also display other helpful information like the time until quests complete or anything else where a countdown (or count up) is helpful.\n\nThe Help Menu: A help menu with information on all of the rules that Jumper is aware of. This can be especially helpful if Jumper is subjected to a complex subsystem of some sort. This menu never displays information hidden from the Jumper because of Drawbacks.\n\nPush Notifications: Dragging you into an extradimensional space every time your benefactor wants to give you a hint, slap some sense into you, or remind you that you’re supposed to be entertaining is inefficient. Now your benefactor can just have messages pop up and tell you that. Message boxes can be made tangible and may be used to smack Jumper on the head as needed.\n\n---\nNote: It doesn't explicitly mention a chat feature as part of the Party Window, but I'm fine with adding that.

The effects of these skills are wide-ranging. They can be practical, such as cleaning to constant use, such as improving perception to combat and other various things. Current known Skill types are:\nDaily Skills, These are skills that can be continuously kept on with little to no use of MP, such as perception and enhancement skills that are ingrained into the body. They do not need to be turned off and on, but they can be if needed.\nExtra Skills, These are skills that are special, in terms of use and versatility. Extra Skills are Skills that can be trained and as training increases and improved the skill level will increase. Extra Skills can also evolve\ninto Unique Skills.\n\nBattle Skills, These are skills that are meant to be used in fights. Battle Skills are a category of Skills that have specific use in battle situations. In low level battles Battle Skills dominate, but in high level battles Unique and Ultimate Skill will dominate.\n\nUnique Skills, They are said to only be possessed by hero class individuals and Unique or Named monsters. They are absolutely unique from any other skill. Even if they appear similar or have the same name, each individual's unique skill will have some sort of subtle difference from another individual.\nHowever, they can be grouped together as a certain general type of Unique Skill. Unique skills can be combined into other Unique Skills or at least one unique skill can have multiple abilities. The power of the Unique skill is directly affected by the strength of the will of the individual possessing it. A powerful Unique skill can rival an Ultimate Skill, even though the power level of an Ultimate skill is generally dramatically higher than that of a Unique skill. Also if an Ultimate Skill is not properly mastered or understood then it can be weaker than it should be and thus weaker than a Unique Skill.\n\nUltimate Skills, They are the pinnacle stage of all skills, hence 'ultimate'. They can arise from Unique Skills evolving or combining appropriate skills together. Though any being can obtain them, they are nearly impossible to obtain. A normal human's body can't handle the burdens of an ultimate skill's energy, so under normal circumstances, awakening one is impossible. That's why the modified body of an Otherworlder or a similar physique is needed. But, at the end of one's training people may Evolve.\nTheir race aside, there certainly is a change. Like from a human to a Sage or a Hero. It is also possible to bestow skills close to Ultimate skills by one's master if he holds an Ultimate Skill by himself, but in a much weaker form, known as Ultimate Gift, but we will get to them later. The Ultimate Skills seem to manifest differently to each person even if they may have the same or similar names. Something like only specific parts and combinations of it being allowed for each person. Ultimate Skills other than the Sin/Virtue Series based on the Seven Deadly Sins and Seven Virtues that evolve into the Lovecraftian Series, The Weapon Lord Series, and the single Ultimate Skill based on Faust, mainly seems to be named after Mythological Figures, from Biblical references to Zoroastrian Gods to Japanese Gods.\n\nUltimate Gifts, they are a degraded form of Ultimate Skills as mentioned before. They are the result of one's master bestowing their Ultimate Skills on to a servant in a weaker form. The strength of the resulting Ultimate Gift will depend on the servant's compatibility with the original skill, their mastery of\nthe skill and the servant's stats.\nAnd Finally Manas, A kind of Spiritual Life Form of ultimate existence, that is a Manas. A Manas can be born when any form of inanimate and intangible existence develops a will and ego, and are able to maintain their own existence in the form of a 'core'. As such, they are more accurately a kind of 'will harborer' or 'will carrier'. Thus, it is natural for them to adopt the will of their original host; a kind of 'inferior psychological clone, that have high resemblance to their original host, but are still very different and\ncannot be considered that same person. Manas is a very unique existence as it can be considered a combination of a spirit, a pseudo soul, an ultimate skill, an individual character and an ego; or none at all. There isn't any concrete and definite 'process' for the birth of a Manas to take place, but simply a collection of conditions that have to be met. It may be conjectured that the three main things needed for their birth are, 'ego/personality', 'will' and 'self-sustenance'. There isn't any particular order in which the first two conditions need to occur, but usually, it is more common for the ego to sprout before the will. The 2 known types of Manas are Ultimate Skills and Emotions that evolved.\n\nAt times, an Ultimate Skill can exist as a separate entity within a user as meager computational existence that can act on its own if needed. Spending time with its owner let’s some parts of their personality “rub\noff” on them, so to speak. In due time and circumstances, this developed ego can play a crucial part in driving their thought processes. In this stage, they are still purely logic driven Ultimate Skills that only exist to serve their masters, but certain behavior similar to human emotions may surface from time to time. So far, the only known method for evolution after this stage, is naming. Apparently, granting a name upon an Ultimate Skill solidifies their individuality and ripens their ego. A separate physical body isn't necessary. The newly formed Manas can live within their user as a spirit. Kind of like having two souls in one body.\nSince it is the core of the Ultimate Skill itself that has been nurtured and evolved, it automatically has self-sustenance. Afterwards, it stops behaving like an Ultimate Skill according to the laws of the World and is treated like a Soul. Meaning, that once a Manas (or its host) 'dies', they are gone for good, unlike Ultimate Skills that are simply 'returned' to the World until a new individual obtains it.\nMoreover, once the Manas is formed, they separate from their Ultimate Skill shell and become a separate existence on their own. Unlike conventional skill evolution, where the integrated/fused skills are erased, here, the Ultimate Skill isn't discarded. Both the Manas and the Ultimate Skills retain the same skill effects, which is basically like having two of the same Ultimate Skills, except that one can think and feel like an actual human. Even if they're kinda the same, the Manas is obviously higher spec than its\nrespective Ultimate Skill. One important factor is that they no longer think through pure logic; their thought processes become more flexible.\nThe other type of development known is when an individual bottles up enormous amounts of their emotions or has a surge or outburst of it right when they die. It is also likely that the particular individual needs to be a powerful existence as a prerequisite. In such a case the emotions stored becomes its own version of the original individual's ego and also plays a huge part in deciding which will of the original individual the Manas will carry. It is unknown how they become Manas, as the only 2 times a Manas\nwas created from Emotions, nobody could’ve named them. It is possible the Manas themselves or the World itself named them.\nSkills will also evolve with the “level” of the individual, referring to their Rank. As an individual levels up and evolves so will their associated skills. This is the most basic way of improving one's skills. Naturally,\nskills can also evolve with practice or proficiency of the specific skill. They can be also be combined to form new and better skills with sufficient and deep knowledge regarding said skill.\n\nFor 300cp you may choose to take along the System to other Jumps and may freely grant access to it to any number or kind of people you want.

The user can adjust the level of acceleration as needed, as well as extend the effect to other individuals.\nThe exact factor by which their thought process is accelerated varies from several hundred to millions or even hundreds of millions, depending on the individual. The two most common variants are a factor of one thousand, most commonly found under Unique skills, and a factor of one million, most commonly found under Ultimate skills.\n\nAnalytical Appraisal ｢解析鑑定, kaiseki kantei｣\nAnalytical Appraisal releases waves that enter the target of analysis and perform a full scan of their composition, which is then sent back to the user. Through this, the user can gain information such as the material composition of the target, the amount of Magicules it possesses, and if they're under the effects of Skills or Magic.\n\nThe strength and precision of Analytical Appraisal varies depending on the level of the user. While an ordinary person might only be able to analyze something through prolonged physical contact, a more advanced user is capable of gathering information with eyesight or through the Extra skill Mana Perception.[1] Though direct physical touch seems to be preferred for the highest level of accuracy.\n\nFor those that have mastered Analytical Appraisal, it is possible for them to get a rough idea of the Skills a person possesses, though for Unique skills the accuracy is extremely poor unless they see it in action.[2]\n\nIt is possible for Analytical Appraisal to fail or be blocked, depending on the target of analysis. For example, the divine steel Hihi'irokane repels all natural wavelengths when not in use, resulting in an inability to be appraised.[3] For individuals of a certain level, especially those who possess Ultimate skills, it becomes significantly harder to perform Analytical Appraisal on them or their abilities, with all results usually turning up as \"Failed\" even when performed by a fellow Ultimate skill User.[4] This can be taken even a step further by beings like Luminous Valentine and Guy Crimson, who are capable of hiding their attributes and putting out false information to deceive Analytical Appraisal.[5][2]\n\nParallel Calculation ｢並列演算, heiretsu enzan｣\nIt allows the user to carry out multiple thought processes simultaneously.[1] Possible applications include the detachment of analysis of phenomena from the user's regular thoughts,[2] and the preservation of consciousness by using additional thought processes as backups.\n\nChant Annulment ｢詠唱破棄, eishō haki｣\nIt eliminates the need for chanting when using magic after a spell is analyzed or successfully cast. The spell is stored in the user's mind and available to be instantly cast just by thinking about its activation.\n\nAll of Creation ｢森羅万象, shinrabanshō｣\nIt allows the user to comprehend anything as long as they have a basic understanding of it and it is perceivable to the user.\n\nAnalysis ｢解析, kaiseki｣: \nThe absorbed target is studied and analyzed.

By taking this perk you will receive the following benefits:\n\nYour physical appearance will be improved as much as possible while still being your physical appearance. This is not referring to the appearance of your pre-Jump body, but rather the concept of you condensed into the physical form of whatever species, lifeform, or other entity you happen to be. Unless it is for the purposes of something like a disguise, you and anything you wear will no longer become dirty, and will always smell pleasant. This affects all Alt-Forms and other transformations.\n\nYou are cured of any injuries, diseases, and any other physical ailments, and your general health is always set to the absolute peak of whatever Alt-Form you are inhabiting. This also comes with a blanket immunity to all mundane and non-setting specific diseases and ailments. So you need not worry about things like cancer, infections, food poisoning, or even the common cold.\n\nYou have perfect executive function and can maintain whatever amount of motivation is necessary to complete any amount of boring or difficult tasks in pursuit of the goals you set for yourself. When required, you can even set yourself on “autopilot” and step back from yourself while completing more mindless tasks, like chores, exercise, and other repetitive or extremely practiced activities. While you are on “autopilot” you will not notice the passing of time. This “autopilot” state will never put you in any kind of danger that might otherwise result from this level of inattentiveness.\n\nOver the next ten subjective years after taking this perk, any mental illnesses and personality flaws you are comfortable not having anymore will be slowly and seamlessly purged from your psyche. You need not worry about this process causing things like the death or unmaking of your personality, as this feature of this perk works to artificially induce these changes in a way identical to how mundane therapy and life experience cause changes in personality.\n\nNo matter how high your highs, you will always be able to enjoy the small things in life, especially those pastimes you find nostalgic. Playing a game, watching a movie, or reading a book will always feel as though you are a child discovering these things for the first time. No matter how much time passes or how many amazing things you experience, you will never lose your ability to be content or even find abundant joy in the mundane pleasures of a normal life.\n\nNo matter how low your lows, you will never succumb to depression or nihilism, and you will never become jaded or indifferent towards the lives of “mortals”. If you wanted to, it wouldn't be that hard to just take a break for a while and “retire” to live the life of a regular powerless person. You would be perfectly content, and no one would ever be able to get more than a small inkling that you are much more than you appear.","value":0,"currency":0,"costModifier":0,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[0,1],"_type":0,"subtype":0},"737":{"_characterId":0,"_jumpId":18,"_id":737,"name":"The Benefits of Research (Free): ","description":"All the skills and powers you learn on your own and even the technology — including things like magitech and psitech — you have learned or will learn how to create, either through normal education, your own invention, or reverse engineering, are now Fiat backed to work no matter what universe you are in.

You may freely modify any visual or auditory effects that accompany the use of these spells when you purchase this perk.\n\nHeal: This spell reverses time in order to undo any injury that has been sustained in the last twenty four hours. Healing head injuries with this spell will also erase any memories formed since said head injury was sustained. While this spell can be cast in a matter of seconds it has no effect on completely dead or uninjured targets. This spell can be cast on any target in visual range.\n\nCure: This channeled healing spell will slowly restore a target to an ideal state of physical health for their age. This spell can treat anything from any form of disease, old injuries, or even birth defects, the only practical limitations on its effects are how long the healing will take and how much mana the healing will cost. Life threatening injuries or diseases can take dozens of hours of sustained treatment with this spell to completely treat.\n\nPurify: This spell is used to break curses and heal esoteric injuries or diseases. Unlike the Cure spell, this spell can be cast over the course of a few moments and need not be channeled in order to convey its full effect. Unfortunately the amount of mana required to break a curse or treat an esoteric injury or ailment can vary depending on their origin, strength, and complexity, and that mana must be paid in full at the time of casting or the spell will fail.

This school of magic works with all magic systems, even things like aura, cultivation, or chakra enhanced ninjutsu. It can also work on things like magitech, but developers can add countermeasures for meta magic if they haven’t already. This won't work on pure technology or metaphysical (comic/sci fi/etc) superpowers.\n\nWhile this perk teaches you a number of spells, and you will be able to cast them all successfully right out of the gate, it will take a great deal of practice to master them to the level required to use them effectively in combat. The following is the list of spells granted by this perk:\n\nMaximized Magic: The targeted spell will be cast with maximum efficiency.\n\nBoosted Magic: Increases the range, speed, and/or area of effect of the targeted spell.\n\nInvisible Magic: The targeted spell is rendered completely invisible. With greater mastery you may even prevent spells from generating sound or heat, and at its peak this bit of meta magic can even render spells completely undetectable to non-divine senses.\n\nWild Magic: The effect of the targeted spell becomes completely randomized. This meta magic spell can do anything from multiplying a spell’s output to erasing it entirely. To say nothing of the more bizarre effects it can (and is much more likely) to have like turning a lightning spell into a polymorph spell or a teleportation spell into an illusion spell.\n\nHardened Magic: Protects the targeted spell from anti-magic effects as well as undesirable meta magics. The overall effectiveness depends on your overall mastery of this meta magic spell.\n\nSilent Magic: Removes the requirement for any chanting or other verbal components from the targeted spell. With greater mastery this meta magic spell can also be used to remove any other non-resource (i.e. reagents, mana, etc) components from spells, such as hand or wand movements.\n\nMulticasting: Allows for the casting of multiple instances of the same spell. With greater mastery you may even be able to use this to cast multiple different spells at the same time.\n\nStack: Delays the activation of a targeted incomplete spell, or the next spell you cast, until you have cast an additional number of meta magic spells on it. This spell was initially intended for inexperienced users, giving them more time to cast meta magic spells, but experienced users eventually discovered that this can also be used to stack normally impractical numbers of meta magic spells on top of one another, mana permitting. Mastery of this spell will increase the amount of meta magic spells that can be stacked.\n\nMirror: Duplicates the effects of the target spell while allowing you to select new targets when applicable. This meta magic spell requires no knowledge, experience, physical components/tools, or innate ability to be cast successfully. This spell’s only requirement is that it must be cast before the targeted spell is completed.\n\nPenetration: The targeted spell will ignore some or all magical defences of its target. The overall effectiveness depends on your overall mastery of this meta magic spell and knowledge of the magical defences you are trying to overcome.\n\nChain: The effect of the targeted spell will chain or bounce to multiple additional targets, with the total number of affected targets being depending on your mastery of this spell. The output of the spell will diminish with each additional target hit, but this can be improved with greater mastery.\n\nSeeker: The affected projectile spell will seek out its intended target, avoiding all obstacles it can find a path around. Affected spells will not be deceived by things like illusions, clones, or decoys. With practice this can be combined with Penetration in order to allow affected spells to pass through magical barriers and other defences.\n\nFlash Casting: After this spell is cast the next spells you cast will be cast instantly. What spells, and how many spells that can be cast this way is limited by your mastery of flash casting and meta magic in general.\n\nDelayed Casting: You can “store” uncast spells in specific locations or objects that can be triggered by any number of conditions, such as the detection of an enemy or specific spell, after a set amount of time passing, or remote trigger through the use of a magic signal.\n\nTransfer: The projectiles produced by ranged spells targeted by Transfer will have said projectiles teleported instantly to a targeted location.\n\nFusion: Fuse one or more spells into a greater whole. This meta magic spell is quite difficult and requires its user to take many variables, such as the compatibility of different elements or concepts, into account in order to be used safely.\n\nInfusion: Adds elemental and/or conceptual effects to the targeted spell.\n\nInversion: Inverts the elements and/or concepts of a targeted spell. For spells that do not include elements or concepts, this spell may invert the targeted spell’s purpose instead, causing a healing spell to cause damage or teleportation spell to restrain its target, for example.\n\nBoost Enchantment: Temporarily increases the performance of any enchantment targeted by this spell.\n\nDispel: Collapses any ongoing magical affect targeted by this spell, provided it is not anchored to a person or physical object (i.e. curses and enchantments).\n\nCounter Target: Changes the target of the affected spell or curse to one of your choosing.\n\nReflection: A faster and more cost efficient version of the Counter Target spell that is limited to forcing affected spells to target their caster. With greater mastery this spell can be set up in such a way as to generate a passive defence that can be maintained semi-permanently.\n\nBackfire: This spell disturbs the energies making up incomplete spells causing them to detonate.\n\nDrain: Drains the energies making up incomplete or ongoing spells, curses, and enchantments and releases them into the surrounding environment. With greater mastery you may instead take control of the drained energies to make use of them yourself.\n\nEncryption: Renders the targeted spell impervious to analysis and reverse engineering. This meta magic spell may provide some protection from certain types of anti-magic and/or meta magic spells and effects that rely on the analysis of the magic they target.","value":400,"currency":0,"costModifier":1,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[3],"_type":0,"subtype":0},"751":{"_characterId":0,"_jumpId":18,"_id":751,"name":"Companion Protections (400CP):","description":"All your Companions are now also under the effects of all of your defensive perks.

Each Apartment must have a kitchen. One kitchen per six people (except for newly budded apartments). That’s the rule. No more Apartments than the total number of kitchens. An Apartment may, of course, have more than one kitchen. Other Extensions can fuse with the Complex if you want.\nEach “Apartment”  is designed for up to six people, but each new “Apartment” starts off as a bud of a previous unit until that unit has more than 9 residents, at which point it can split off into a separate unit, but that need not happen. Thirty-two Apartments make a single standard “Building” at which point the Building divides into two with sixteen “Apartments” each and the process begins again. The exact layout of each Apartment is subject to change by the residents, and how the various Apartments in a Building is subject to the residents of that Building’s approval, but in general, the default is 4 Apartments per floor. Elevators are included for free. The arrangement of the Buildings themselves relative to each other can be changed by you or any administrator you appoint. Personal Rooms move with their owners if they change Apartments.\nThis housing is not luxurious by any means, but the individual rooms tailor themselves to the general likes of their owner and come with basic but not quality furniture. Non-bedrooms are on the small side but large enough to function. Floors are basic linoleum and walls are basic low grade paint. Appliances and fixtures are pretty bare bones and the walls are little more than plywood and wood frame. The bedrooms don’t have closets. \nThe Housing Complex only provides rooms for Companions, Permanent Followers, Pets, and the Offspring of those previous groups. You, the Jumper, of course get a room if you want one.","value":100,"currency":0,"costModifier":0,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[1],"_type":5,"duration":-1,"supplement":0},"1118":{"_characterId":0,"_jumpId":7,"_id":1118,"name":"MANY HAPPY RETURNS","description":"=200 WP=\nYou may spend ten more years in a world you have visited before.

Extra Skills are Skills that can be trained and as training increases and improved the skill level will increase.

Battle Skills are a category of Skills that have specific use in battle situations. In low level battles Battle Skills dominate, but in high level battles Unique and Ultimate Skill will dominate.\n\nUnique Skills, They are said to only be possessed by hero class individuals and Unique or Named monsters. They are absolutely unique from any other skill. Even if they appear similar or have the same name, each individual's unique skill will have some sort of subtle difference from another individual.\nHowever, they can be grouped together as a certain general type of Unique Skill.

The power of the Unique skill is directly affected by the strength of the will of the individual possessing it.

They can arise from Unique Skills evolving or combining appropriate skills together. Though any being can obtain them, they are nearly impossible to obtain. A normal human's body can't handle the burdens of an ultimate skill's energy, so under normal circumstances, awakening one is impossible.

The Ultimate Skills seem to manifest differently to each person even if they may have the same or similar names. Something like only specific parts and combinations of it being allowed for each person. Ultimate Skills other than the Sin/Virtue Series based on the Seven Deadly Sins and Seven Virtues that evolve into the Lovecraftian Series, The Weapon Lord Series, and the single Ultimate Skill based on Faust, mainly seems to be named after Mythological Figures, from Biblical references to Zoroastrian Gods to Japanese Gods.\n\nUltimate Gifts, they are a degraded form of Ultimate Skills as mentioned before. They are the result of one's master bestowing their Ultimate Skills on to a servant in a weaker form. The strength of the resulting Ultimate Gift will depend on the servant's compatibility with the original skill, their mastery of\nthe skill and the servant's stats.\nAnd Finally Manas, A kind of Spiritual Life Form of ultimate existence, that is a Manas. A Manas can be born when any form of inanimate and intangible existence develops a will and ego, and are able to maintain their own existence in the form of a 'core'. As such, they are more accurately a kind of 'will harborer' or 'will carrier'. Thus, it is natural for them to adopt the will of their original host; a kind of 'inferior psychological clone, that have high resemblance to their original host, but are still very different and\ncannot be considered that same person. Manas is a very unique existence as it can be considered a combination of a spirit, a pseudo soul, an ultimate skill, an individual character and an ego; or none at all. There isn't any concrete and definite 'process' for the birth of a Manas to take place, but simply a collection of conditions that have to be met. It may be conjectured that the three main things needed for their birth are, 'ego/personality', 'will' and 'self-sustenance'. There isn't any particular order in which the first two conditions need to occur, but usually, it is more common for the ego to sprout before the will. The 2 known types of Manas are Ultimate Skills and Emotions that evolved.\n\nAt times, an Ultimate Skill can exist as a separate entity within a user as meager computational existence that can act on its own if needed. Spending time with its owner let’s some parts of their personality “rub\noff” on them, so to speak. In due time and circumstances, this developed ego can play a crucial part in driving their thought processes. In this stage, they are still purely logic driven Ultimate Skills that only exist to serve their masters, but certain behavior similar to human emotions may surface from time to time. So far, the only known method for evolution after this stage, is naming. Apparently, granting a name upon an Ultimate Skill solidifies their individuality and ripens their ego. A separate physical body isn't necessary. The newly formed Manas can live within their user as a spirit. Kind of like having two souls in one body.\nSince it is the core of the Ultimate Skill itself that has been nurtured and evolved, it automatically has self-sustenance. Afterwards, it stops behaving like an Ultimate Skill according to the laws of the World and is treated like a Soul. Meaning, that once a Manas (or its host) 'dies', they are gone for good, unlike Ultimate Skills that are simply 'returned' to the World until a new individual obtains it.\nMoreover, once the Manas is formed, they separate from their Ultimate Skill shell and become a separate existence on their own. Unlike conventional skill evolution, where the integrated/fused skills are erased, here, the Ultimate Skill isn't discarded. Both the Manas and the Ultimate Skills retain the same skill effects, which is basically like having two of the same Ultimate Skills, except that one can think and feel like an actual human. Even if they're kinda the same, the Manas is obviously higher spec than its\nrespective Ultimate Skill. One important factor is that they no longer think through pure logic; their thought processes become more flexible.\nThe other type of development known is when an individual bottles up enormous amounts of their emotions or has a surge or outburst of it right when they die. It is also likely that the particular individual needs to be a powerful existence as a prerequisite. In such a case the emotions stored becomes its own version of the original individual's ego and also plays a huge part in deciding which will of the original individual the Manas will carry. It is unknown how they become Manas, as the only 2 times a Manas\nwas created from Emotions, nobody could’ve named them. It is possible the Manas themselves or the World itself named them.\nSkills will also evolve with the “level” of the individual, referring to their Rank. As an individual levels up and evolves so will their associated skills. This is the most basic way of improving one's skills. Naturally,\nskills can also evolve with practice or proficiency of the specific skill.

Meaning, that once a Manas (or its host) 'dies', they are gone for good, unlike Ultimate Skills that are simply 'returned' to the World until a new individual obtains it.\nMoreover, once the Manas is formed, they separate from their Ultimate Skill shell and become a separate existence on their own. Unlike conventional skill evolution, where the integrated/fused skills are erased, here, the Ultimate Skill isn't discarded. Both the Manas and the Ultimate Skills retain the same skill effects, which is basically like having two of the same Ultimate Skills, except that one can think and feel like an actual human. Even if they're kinda the same, the Manas is obviously higher spec than its\nrespective Ultimate Skill. One important factor is that they no longer think through pure logic; their thought processes become more flexible.\nThe other type of development known is when an individual bottles up enormous amounts of their emotions or has a surge or outburst of it right when they die. It is also likely that the particular individual needs to be a powerful existence as a prerequisite. In such a case the emotions stored becomes its own version of the original individual's ego and also plays a huge part in deciding which will of the original individual the Manas will carry. It is unknown how they become Manas, as the only 2 times a Manas\nwas created from Emotions, nobody could’ve named them. It is possible the Manas themselves or the World itself named them.\nSkills will also evolve with the “level” of the individual, referring to their Rank. As an individual levels up and evolves so will their associated skills. This is the most basic way of improving one's skills. Naturally,\nskills can also evolve with practice or proficiency of the specific skill. They can be also be combined to form new and better skills with sufficient and deep knowledge regarding said skill.\n\nFor 300cp you may choose to take along the System to other Jumps and may freely grant access to it to any number or kind of people you want.

As you gain levels in a class, you will gain new [Skills], enabling you to do things that you would not be able to do normally. Leveling and gaining a class relies on mentality - if you are convinced that you cannot cook, or you do not find cooking to be important, for example, it is unlikely that you will ever gain a [Basic Cooking] skill, regardless of your actual skill in cooking - an example of this can be seen with Erin Solstice's lack of the [Tactician] class, despite her skill in chess.\n\nThe majority of people reach Level 20 in at least one class over the course of their lives. Much less individuals manage to reach Level 30; A handful in each town; a few dozen in a city. Few people ever reach Level 40, and they tend to be quite famous. People who have reached Level 50 or above are generally known throughout the world. It is later determined that there seems to be a cap on the amount of levels one can gain, of 100 cumulative levels. This means at most a person could gain 100 levels of a chosen class or 50 levels in two seperate classes or even less levels split amongst multiple classes.\n\nYou can now take advantage of this set up and gain [Classes] and [Skills] yourself by putting hard work and effort into something to gain levels in it making yourself stronger and better at it, doing so will give you the ability to level and before you sleep you will hear a voice in you mind telling you what levels, [Class]es or [Skill]s you have gained.

As you gain levels in a class, you will gain new [Skills], enabling you to do things that you would not be able to do normally. Leveling and gaining a class relies on mentality - if you are convinced that you cannot cook, or you do not find cooking to be important, for example, it is unlikely that you will ever gain a [Basic Cooking] skill, regardless of your actual skill in cooking - an example of this can be seen with Erin Solstice's lack of the [Tactician] class, despite her skill in chess.\n\nThe majority of people reach Level 20 in at least one class over the course of their lives. Much less individuals manage to reach Level 30; A handful in each town; a few dozen in a city. Few people ever reach Level 40, and they tend to be quite famous. People who have reached Level 50 or above are generally known throughout the world. It is later determined that there seems to be a cap on the amount of levels one can gain, of 100 cumulative levels. This means at most a person could gain 100 levels of a chosen class or 50 levels in two seperate classes or even less levels split amongst multiple classes.\n\nYou can now take advantage of this set up and gain [Classes] and [Skills] yourself by putting hard work and effort into something to gain levels in it making yourself stronger and better at it, doing so will give you the ability to level and before you sleep you will hear a voice in you mind telling you what levels, [Class]es or [Skill]s you have gained. Should you choose not to receive a new [Class] or [Skill] you can cancel it thereby avoiding losing levels you may want to allocate elsewhere.\n\nYou gain this perk for free however if you wish you may pay 200 cp to gain the ability to grant this perk to others in future jumps.  If a [Class] does not exist there is the possibility to bring it into existence by working hard in a way you think should grant the class as is shown with the [Doctor], [Clown], [Cataphract], or [Medic] classes which were gained simply by the person wanting the class, doing things they thought important to the class and working hard for it.

Your only restraints become time and resources.\n\nRunepowder is a magical version of the original smokepowder, but its destructive potency is increased by a manifold. A vial of rune power has more than double the explosive power of a barrel of smokepowder. Just imagine what a barrel of this stuff can do.\n\nSpeaking of barrels, you get a barrel filled with this powder once a jump. You also get a weekly supply of a single barrel of smokepowder. Refining a vial of runepowder takes about a half a barrel of smokepowder and a great investment of magical energy. This energy can either be provided by you or if you are incapable of providing this magical energy, adding half of a smokepowder barrel more can be used as compensation for the lack of magic.\n\nBarrels will be delivered either to your campsite or your cosmic warehouse.","value":400,"currency":0,"costModifier":1,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[3],"_type":1,"subtype":1},"2493":{"_characterId":0,"_jumpId":51,"_id":2493,"name":"House of the Damned","description":"You are the proud owner of an accursed residence that seems to be located in a land of fire and smoke that very closely resembles Avernus, the First of the Nine Hells of Baator. In fact, your residence is located in Avernus. Don’t worry about any devils or demons infiltrating it though, you got some protections installed.\n\nThe design and architecture of your manor is heavily inspired by Raphael’s House of Hope (don’t let him know) but it is up for renovations, if Victorian Infernal style is not to your taste. It is located in a cliff face that overlooks a ravine littered with fiery pits and rivers. You have imps and other lesser devils in the house, working as servants. They number in dozens, and they are completely loyal and devoted to you. But you cannot take any of them out of the house.\n\nOnly people you designate can go in and out of this residence, and its location is far from the frontlines of the Blood War. So, there will be no demons barging in through your front door. The only way to go in and out of this house is via portals or teleportation.\n\nSpeaking of portals, you have a portal room in the house that can open up a portal to any location you are vaguely familiar with in the material plane of your current jump’s main world. This doesn’t allow you to appear in any indoor or private locations though. Other facilities provided by the house are also useful (in most cases) and quite luxurious. You have multiple feasting halls and relief chambers along with lovely balconies and terraces. You have access to a private boudoir that contains a rejuvenation spring that can make you as good as new just with an hour of rest along with a shapeshifting succubus/incubus that can entertain you or your guests. An archive will be provided, if you want to display your justly earned artifacts (don’t worry the archives are fully trapped in the case of intruders). Basement of the manor also acts as a minor prison complex that hangs from the bottom of your house overlooking the ravine and has two spectators guarding it along with armed imps. Finally, you get a collection of four soul pillars that contain the souls of thousands of damned (don’t worry they deserve such punishment and they are mostly non-sentient at this point) that can be used to boost your powers to a ridiculous degree, when you are standing near them.\n\nIf you are still worried about intruders even after having a cadre of devils and magical protections guarding your house, with just a thought you can summon semi-sentient flaming boulders that will try to immolate and crush any intruders at your behest. Oh, and any attempts at divination targeting the people in the house will simply fail, if that is your desire.\n\nOccasionally dead or lost souls can wander into your house to make deals, if you allow them that is.\n\nYou can teleport yourself and any people you like in and out of this house as many times as you want with a simple gesture. Post-jump this house will be relocated to a hell-like pocket plane, or it can be attached to your warehouse.","value":800,"currency":0,"costModifier":1,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[9,15],"_type":1,"subtype":1},"2495":{"_characterId":0,"_jumpId":51,"_id":2495,"name":"Outfoxed","description":"Ah, the contracts established between mortals and creatures of immense guile. Such an easy prospect, ripe for manipulation by beings with centuries of experience in the art. But in these kinds of dealings, you are neither the mouse that gets clawed nor the cat chasing its prey endlessly. You are the fox, biding your time for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nBe it fey, infernal or divine in nature, no contract or oath can bind you to obey their terms, if they are unfit for you to abide. At any time you want, you can nullify all effects these kinds of magical bindings have over you, and not suffer the consequences of breaking them. Not only that, but you can even keep all the positive things you have gained from them upon breaking those deals. A paladin may find themselves losing their divine power, if they were to break the tenets of their sworn oath… not you though. A warlock may find themselves powerless and turned into a devilish wretch, if they were to butt heads with their patron… not you though. Oh, and while you are terminating this contract on your part, you can choose to terminate it so that only you are exempt from the binding tenets and not invalidate the contract as a whole. So, a divine oath forcing two sides to truce may be broken by you, but the other party is prevented from hurting you, while you can do whatever you want.\n\nAnd do you know what the best part of this is? No being can know beforehand that you have this ability. At least before you break out of contract with them, and even then, your wondrous power can only be known by this entity alone. The being you broke contract with can’t spread word that you are an untrustworthy fellow, and if they were to, no one would believe them.\n\nOh, and did I forget to mention? You can use this ability on other people who have contracts, be they willing or not. But when used this way, at least a year must pass, if you want to use it against other people again.\n\nAs a final extra, you gain the experience of a centuries-old devil that is famous for its dealings among mortals. You always know what deals are best to take for you, properly assess the risks taken versus rewards gained and have a godly bargaining skill. Unfortunately, this doesn’t grant you any pact-making capabilities (‘psst’ you have to purchase an item for that).\n\nUse this power wisely, mortal, some entities may take offense if their hard-earned soul was to simply be snatched away from their grasp.","value":600,"currency":0,"costModifier":0,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[3],"_type":0,"subtype":0},"2496":{"_characterId":0,"_jumpId":51,"_id":2496,"name":"Elminster’s Obsession (100)","description":"No, you don’t get the interest of the legendary wizard of the Realms.

The condition for completing this scenario is quite simple on paper but very hard to do in action. You must disrupt the master plan of the Dead Three and put an end to the threat of Nether Brain enacting the Grand Design of the illithids. You fail this scenario if the Grand Design is completed, either by the Dead Three or the Nether Brain.\n\nRegardless of the location you pick, you’ll start in the Nautiloid in Hell location, and you are destined to encounter all of the original crew during your adventure. After you survive your hellish journey, whether you help the druids or goblins at the ravaged beach is fully up to you. During your time here you are guaranteed to encounter Raphael, and he will make life interesting for you by tempting you with his deals.\n\nThen your journey must lead you to Moonrise Towers one way or another, and fate itself will prevent you from reaching Baldur’s Gate before you deal with Ketheric Thorm and his minions. Once you defeat him, you get his netherstone.\n\nDuring your tenure in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, you’ll finally have the chance to meet your dream visitor, namely the Emperor, aka Balduran himself. He’ll offer you many benefits, but at the same time try to manipulate you to go along with his wants.\n\nOnce you reach Baldur's Gate, Gortash and Orin will both offer you deals and hound your steps at the same time. You must navigate through the schemes and dangers plaguing the city perfectly, and find a way to collect all of the Netherstones from the remaining Chosen. Then you must control the Crown of Karsus to put an end to the Grand Design once and for all.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t end here. Only an illithid can match the thinking process of the mutated Nether Brain and control it using netherstones. You’ll have to make a grim decision, if you don’t have OCP means of dealing with the Nether Brain: Either you or one of your companions must turn into a mind flayer to deal with the brain otherwise. The Emperor will offer his assistance, if you trust him with the netherstones that is, and he will stay loyal to his word until the brain is defeated. You can also get the assistance of Orpheus, if you free him. But doing so will make the Emperor betray you and join the Nether Brain.\n\nNo matter what methods you use or what path you walk, as long as you command the brain to destroy itself and the tadpoles of the infected, you win this scenario.","value":200,"currency":0,"costModifier":0,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[],"_type":4,"duration":1,"reward":"Rewards heavily depend on the side you take during your endgame.\n\nIn all versions, you get a higher chance of persuading cannon crew (including Act 2 and Act 3 companions) to join you on your further adventures as a companion, if you had a friendly relationship with them that is.

If you already have the perk, you’ll get the amount you spent on it refunded back to you. On top of that, the Emperor can join you as a companion on your adventures. He will gain all the things a Dream Companion can do and has the experiences and skills of a legendary adventurer well over level 20.\n\nIf you have sided with Orpheus and didn’t trust the Emperor: Orpheus won’t join you but will gift you with all the knowledge collected by githyanki on the topic of ghaik, essentially giving you the Astral Knowledge perk.

In the manga, only Heroes of legends past have had more than one blessing, and in the anime adaptation, no one has had more than one. Mukoda has four of them , even if they are minor blessings, Demiurge's in particular being incredibly rare. Meanwhile, Fel , Sui , and Dora  have full-force blessings from the gods. \n\nBlessings are special powers granted by the gods of the Divine Realm to certain individuals. They usually require offerings or contracts in exchange for the blessings, and can enhance one’s abilities, skills, or luck. For example, Mukohda, the protagonist of the series, has four minor blessings from different gods, His familiars, Fel, Sui, and Dora, also have full-force blessings from the gods, such as Fel’s blessing of the God of War, which makes him a powerful Magic Knight. Blessings are rare and coveted in the fantasy world, and often attract the attention of other people or monsters. Mukoda was blessed by the goddess of fire, earth, wind, and the god of creation (all are but small blessings) has given him protection (even if it is \"small\", this has dramatically increased his quality of life and lifespan itself), similar to Mukoda you can gain blessings from these or other types of gods (this perk can be bought multiple times for multiple small blessings).\n\nExamples: One of the things that Mukohda's familiars relish is a good fight with some tough (and tasty) monsters, much to his consternation. This is intensified when Vaughn, the God of War, gives his blessing to Fel and Dora, to exhort Mukoda into giving him offerings as well. The blessing boosts their stats, with the side effect of increasing their bloodlust.\n\nMukoda initially could only produce a puff of fire and a small pebble with his Fireball and Stone Bullet spells respectively. But after some practice and the blessings of the gods, he could easily conjure explosive basketball-size fireballs and rapid-fire rock shards.","value":200,"currency":0,"costModifier":0,"purchaseValue":0,"tags":[],"category":[10],"_type":0,"subtype":0},"2983":{"_characterId":0,"_jumpId":64,"_id":2983,"name":"Gourmet’s Tongue","description":" [100 CP] - You have a refined palate that can appreciate the subtle flavors and qualities of any food.

One runs from the Canaat Mountain range. The other along the large Ameld river. These connect the north and south forests. But this is not a straight path, as the river runs east along the way.

Therefore, it is the Empire’s lifeline. So flawless security is applied.\nThere is a lake in the center of the Jura Forest, called Shisu. A marsh surrounds the lake, and is controlled by the Lizardmen. Countless caves surround their lands, forming a natural labyrinth thwarting any invasion. Protected thus by the land itself, the Lizardmen peacefully rules over the lake. The western route is home to the Ogre’s village. The marshes are also located in the west.\nThe monsters of the forest were under the impression that they received divine protection from Storm Dragon Veldora.

They strike fear into the hearts of their enemies and their rage makes them deadly combatants who can shrug off injuries and who can terrorize their foes. They are often tanks. They gain their subclass at level 3.\n\nMonks are skilled, deadly, warriors who specialize in manipulating ki, both theirs and that of others. They do not need huge, heavy weapons to deal incredible harm and to stun or weaken their foes. They are swift, precise warriors who can fell even whole groups of people with martial arts and their ki manipulations. They also gain powerful abilities through self-improvement and are capable of incredible feats of martial and dexterous prowess. They gain their subclass at level 3.
