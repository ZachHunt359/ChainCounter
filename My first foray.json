      "description": "Cosmetic Refinement (free for all): Upon obtaining this perk, you may freely reshape your body into any configuration that occurs naturally or requires only minor cosmetics assistance (makeup, hair dye, contacts). Heights can range from half a meter to three meters with proportionate weight between twenty five kilos and five hundred kilos and sufficient strength to move normally. This change can make you as attractive as the most attractive model wearing the most skillfully applied makeup, but does not confer any supernatural benefits.\n\nPhysical Health Refinement (free for all): You are cured of any physical and genetic issues and will not suffer from many common issues, such as cancer, as you age. You also gain the ability to render yourself fertile or infertile at will. You may choose to stop or start any menstrual or breeding cycle at will.\n\nPhysical Prowess Refinement (free for all): If below that level, your health and fitness increases to that of an average active, healthy person in their prime. Your physical fitness level will not deteriorate over time or through disuse, as long as your basic needs are met. You can perform at approximately half of peak human performance as described in the Notes section.\n\nMental Health Refinement (free for all): If below that level, your mental health increases to that of an average person in sound mental health. You are resistant (but not immune) to developing issues such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression. You do not have issues with self-motivation or the general mental fatigue that living for centuries may cause.\n\nMental Awareness Refinement (free for all): By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of any mental illnesses or other issues that you are suffering from. While this does not automatically remove those issues, it does tell you how to best deal with them, making therapy dramatically more efficient and providing a degree of leverage in coping with them.\n\nSpiritual Awareness Refinement (free for all): By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of the state of your own soul, including any outside influences upon it or damage it has suffered. If all or part of your soul is no longer in your possession, you also gain a vague idea of where it is located and who is currently holding it. This does not allow for removal of those influences, but it does give you an idea of where to start.\n\nSpiritual Resource Refinement (free for all): You may use all forms of non-physical energy interchangeably, effectively removing your need to track resources for individual types of powers. Whether this means that you can cast spells using chakra, perform martial arts using psionic power points, or some other combination is up to you.\n\nSecondary Powers Refinement (free for all): You automatically gain any ‘secondary powers’ required for your other powers to function. For instance, if you have a power that lets you run at supersonic speeds, you automatically gain a secondary power that keeps you from tearing yourself apart while using it. This power, in short, allows your powers to function by comic book physics.",

      "description": "You have a video-game like interface which provides information and possibly communication options. If you have another interface of this nature, they will merge together seamlessly. Unlike other perks in this document, this perk is not chosen by the Jumper. Instead, the Benefactor selects whether this perk is used and which features are enabled. At the Benefactor’s discretion, some or all of these options may be available to Companions as well as the Jumper. Some common options include:\n\nThe Character Sheet: Pull up your current character sheet. It has helpful information on all of the mechanical information that you are aware of. Typically, this includes Perks, Powers, and Items that have been purchased with CP, Companions and their general status (in-jump, dead, alive, etc.), and drawbacks. This sheet never displays information hidden from the Jumper because of Drawbacks.\n\nThe Status Window: A small window that tells Jumper their current physical status. How descriptive and useful this is can vary wildly. In the best case, it’s a detailed accounting of injuries, status conditions, and other effects the character is under. In the worst case, it’s a little outline of the Jumper that glows in a color from green to red to show where injuries are (or black if something has been severed).\n\nThe Party Window: A window that gives the Jumper a listing of their active and inactive companions. The exact amount of information on the window can vary, but usually includes a status indicator of some sort (see Status Window, above) and may include things like mood, location, and access to their own character sheets.\n\nThe Quest Window: Does your benefactor have a list of tasks for you on this Jump? Is there something you have to do to resolve the plot so you can move on? This will keep a handy list of those things. It may or may not display progress toward your goals.\n\nThe Timer Window: A simple timer window that tells the Jumper how long they have left until their next jump. May also display other helpful information like the time until quests complete or anything else where a countdown (or count up) is helpful.\n\nThe Help Menu: A help menu with information on all of the rules that Jumper is aware of. This can be especially helpful if Jumper is subjected to a complex subsystem of some sort. This menu never displays information hidden from the Jumper because of Drawbacks.\n\nPush Notifications: Dragging you into an extradimensional space every time your benefactor wants to give you a hint, slap some sense into you, or remind you that you’re supposed to be entertaining is inefficient. Now your benefactor can just have messages pop up and tell you that. Message boxes can be made tangible and may be used to smack Jumper on the head as needed.",

It is contained within its own reality that contains absolutely nothing else (guaranteed) and no matter where you go (unless blocked by a drawback or gauntlet) you’ll always be able to access it. Before you do anything with it, it looks like a fairly dimly lit and very empty room. \n\nYour Warehouse forms the base of your Personal Reality, with any additions you buy or make expanding it through various means. Anything added to the Warehouse via CP purchase is guaranteed to work flawlessly with anything and everything else attached to the Warehouse. Anything added by the use of fiat-backed powers or abilities is likewise guaranteed to seamlessly integrate. This means that, although you can’t just buy a house with cash in a jump and integrate it into your warehouse, you could enchant a closet already in your Warehouse with Harry Potter brand ‘bigger on the inside’ magic if you’ve been to a Harry Potter jump. Essentially, you’ll get a complete set of manuals on how each thing you buy functions and listing how various techs and magics that you have already purchased can be integrated with what you have already.

This includes Pets, Pokémon, Digimon, AIs, VIs, Sapient Sinks, even that strange Magical Fungus that grew in your fridge. Any Companion may leave your Personal Reality and enter the Host Reality as a Drop-In with Zero CP at any time as long as you have not taken a Drawback barring such action or created some kind of Lockdown on your PR. While any number of non-imported companions can be out in a Host Reality at any time, unless the jump specifically allows more than 8 active companions, no more than 8 non-imported companions can be at a power level higher than the local elite mooks or peak human, whichever is greater.

      "description": "With this option you gain enough housing for every sapient you have in your retinue. Each adult or juvenile sapient (need not be a sophont) among those beings you allow to live permanently (or semi-permanently) in your Personality reality gets their own personal bedroom... Although technically they can do whatever they like with their own room, as odds are good a great many of your followers might be sleeping together at any given time. Personal rooms can be merged if all the occupants so desire. Each personal room defaults to 5 meters by 4 meters by 3 meters.\n\nThe standard unit of this Complex is the “Apartment”. By default, each “Apartment” contains four “bedrooms” when created, a kitchen & dining room, two full bathrooms with combination shower / bathtubs, two general purpose shared rooms (offices, living rooms, game rooms), a few small closets, and a pantry. Each Apartment must have a kitchen. One kitchen per six people (except for newly budded apartments). That’s the rule. No more Apartments than the total number of kitchens. An Apartment may, of course, have more than one kitchen. Other Extensions can fuse with the Complex if you want.\n\nEach “Apartment” is designed for up to six people, but each new “Apartment” starts off as a bud of a previous unit until that unit has more than 9 residents, at which point it can split off into a separate unit, but that need not happen. Thirty-two Apartments make a single standard “Building” at which point the Building divides into two with sixteen “Apartments” each and the process begins again. The exact layout of each Apartment is subject to change by the residents, and how the various Apartments in a Building is subject to the residents of that Building’s approval, but in general, the default is 4 Apartments per floor. Elevators are included for free. The arrangement of the Buildings themselves relative to each other can be changed by you or any administrator you appoint. Personal Rooms move with their owners if they change Apartments.\n\nThis housing is not luxurious by any means, but the individual rooms tailor themselves to the general likes of their owner and come with basic but not quality furniture. Non-bedrooms are on the small side but large enough to function. Floors are basic linoleum and walls are basic low grade paint. Appliances and fixtures are pretty bare bones and the walls are little more than plywood and wood frame. The bedrooms don’t have closets.\n\nThe Housing Complex only provides rooms for Companions, Permanent Followers, Pets, and the Offspring of those previous groups. You, the Jumper, of course get a room if you want one.",

He will usually walk off with your best loot, usually he gives it to newer adventurers to give them a better chance. For an extra 100CP, once a week he leads a noob training group to teach them his ways. While you can kill them until they are up to snuff he will keep an eye on the group to make sure more than one doesn’t die at a time. He also is a troll of the highest order and knows how much he gets on your nerves. Only good thing is he will make sure no one destroys your core, if only to make you suffer more.

The other ways to gain DP require interacting with the dungeon's visitors, while they are inside the dungeon you will passively absorb energy from them gaining DP at a varying rate depending on the strength of the visitor. If a visitor dies in your dungeon you will gain a sum total of DP at a varying rate depending on the strength of the visitor and can then sell their corpse to gain more.\n\nPost-Jump you may use the Dungeon Menu even when not in the dungeon but will not be able to gain additional DP until you return to the dungeon and gain any that has been generated since your last visit.",

You also gain all the languages of the forms you take.\n\nAdditionally, a Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. If slain, a Lord’s soul reforms within one week, inhabiting another of its species on the Material Plane. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap your soul) prevents this. To permanently kill a Lord, one must destroy every one of your species in existence (so your soul has no creature to inhabit). While your species and those related to you will not attack you on their own, they can be controlled to do so. There can be only one Lord per species.",

You can walk as far into the woods as you like, but you’ll eventually come out on the other side of your Personal Reality. The trees are a mix of common trees from Earth and you can customize them to your liking with sliders to control how many pines, oaks, poplars, palms, apple trees, etc. The trees will naturally cycle through a year over the course of a year.

This can change the gravity from 0.00001 gees all the way up to 8 gees, the temperature anywhere from -40 °C all the way up to 180 °C. Comes with a tablet that has all the system controls you’ll need and a big ol’ box of wireless thermostats. The direction of gravity can be easily manipulated in whole or part of your Reality. So if you want to build a Labyrinth style room with doors and stairs going every-which-way, feel free. This virtually eliminates dust build up (1,000th normal).

Heights can range from half a meter to three meters with proportionate weight between twenty five kilos and five hundred kilos and sufficient strength to move normally. This change can make you as attractive as the most attractive model wearing the most skillfully applied makeup, but does not confer any supernatural benefits.\n\nPhysical Health Refinement (free for all): You are cured of any physical and genetic issues and will not suffer from many common issues, such as cancer, as you age. You also gain the ability to render yourself fertile or infertile at will. You may choose to stop or start any menstrual or breeding cycle at will.\n\nPhysical Prowess Refinement (free for all): If below that level, your health and fitness increases to that of an average active, healthy person in their prime. Your physical fitness level will not deteriorate over time or through disuse, as long as your basic needs are met. You can perform at approximately half of peak human performance as described in the Notes section.\n\nMental Health Refinement (free for all): If below that level, your mental health increases to that of an average person in sound mental health. You are resistant (but not immune) to developing issues such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression. You do not have issues with self-motivation or the general mental fatigue that living for centuries may cause.\n\nMental Awareness Refinement (free for all): By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of any mental illnesses or other issues that you are suffering from. While this does not automatically remove those issues, it does tell you how to best deal with them, making therapy dramatically more efficient and providing a degree of leverage in coping with them.\n\nSpiritual Awareness Refinement (free for all): By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of the state of your own soul, including any outside influences upon it or damage it has suffered. If all or part of your soul is no longer in your possession, you also gain a vague idea of where it is located and who is currently holding it. This does not allow for removal of those influences, but it does give you an idea of where to start.\n\nSpiritual Resource Refinement (free for all): You may use all forms of non-physical energy interchangeably, effectively removing your need to track resources for individual types of powers. Whether this means that you can cast spells using chakra, perform martial arts using psionic power points, or some other combination is up to you.\n\nSecondary Powers Refinement (free for all): You automatically gain any ‘secondary powers’ required for your other powers to function. For instance, if you have a power that lets you run at supersonic speeds, you automatically gain a secondary power that keeps you from tearing yourself apart while using it.

This change can make you as attractive as the most attractive model wearing the most skillfully applied makeup, but does not confer any supernatural benefits.\n\nPhysical Health Refinement (free for all): You are cured of any physical and genetic issues and will not suffer from many common issues, such as cancer, as you age. You also gain the ability to render yourself fertile or infertile at will. You may choose to stop or start any menstrual or breeding cycle at will.\n\nPhysical Prowess Refinement (free for all): If below that level, your health and fitness increases to that of an average active, healthy person in their prime. Your physical fitness level will not deteriorate over time or through disuse, as long as your basic needs are met.

If all or part of your soul is no longer in your possession, you also gain a vague idea of where it is located and who is currently holding it. This does not allow for removal of those influences, but it does give you an idea of where to start.\n\nSpiritual Resource Refinement (free for all): You may use all forms of non-physical energy interchangeably, effectively removing your need to track resources for individual types of powers.

For instance, if you have a power that lets you run at supersonic speeds, you automatically gain a secondary power that keeps you from tearing yourself apart while using it.

When the Crey research scientists realized that she had no family and few friends, they decided to try some of their more dangerous procedures on her. A volatile serum transformed Katherine and gave her some feline features and characteristics. Crey considered the result a failure because Katherine could not be controlled. She managed to break free of her captors, scarring the face of one of Crey's top scientists horribly with her claws.\n\nAdopting the identity of Mynx, Katherine lived on the streets of Paragon City for a time. She got involved in petty crimes to keep herself alive. Synapse discovered her there and helped her develop control of her heightened reflexes and her animalistic nature. She is still undisciplined and prone to overconfidence, but is fiercely loyal to Synapse and grateful for the second chance he has given her.",

      "name": "Willow Rosenberg",
      "gender": "Female",
      "originalAge": "22",
      "personality": {
        "personality": "Willow was a consistently sweet, trusting, gentle, intelligent, caring person. She was a somewhat naive, painfully shy nerd who was stuck with a hopeless crush on her best friend Xander. She was socially awkward on more than one occasion but had a kind heart.[citation needed] She became much more confident and strong-willed, capably leading the Scooby Gang twice during Buffy's absences.[33][11] When Buffy died, Willow took care of Dawn,[11] to whom she represented a maternal figure.[134] Willow was friendly and understanding, though she was not afraid to be tough. While still having an easily nervous nature, she grew more outspoken and confident.[citation needed]\n\nWillow was also loyal and supportive to her friends, especially Buffy and Xander as she almost never openly criticized their decisions with hostility even when she disagreed, a factor in her understanding nature. She normally did not display fits of anger toward those who done her wrong, even if they were her close friends, retaining a calm and receptive demeanor.[citation needed] She also often spoke in strange speeches and phrases,[48] something she shared with her best friend Buffy, which could often confuse those around her who weren't used to it.[citation needed] She was also greatly emotional and prone to babble when nervous[7] (which was another similarity to Buffy).[8]\n\nWillow was also determined to get things done that she feels are important. It was sometimes hard for people to change her mind, a sign of this being her \"resolve face.\"[5] Willow often did not hold grudges against people. In fact, she was usually one of the first to forgive people for their mistakes, even if large ones, being incredibly forgiving. Another notable trait of Willow was her remarkable ability to put aside grudges and personal feelings to get an important task done which she had done on numerous occasions, most notably with Faith[66] and much later, with Angel.[96]\n\nWillow also had a gift with computers and cracking codes, which was seen many times throughout the years. During her high school and college days, she seemed to be the only one out of the Scooby Gang that actually enjoyed going to school and doing homework as well as tutoring, much to the confusion of Buffy and Xander.[citation needed] She had a great interest in science and technology, seen with her fascination with the Buffybot.[135]\n\nDespite her many good qualities, she could also display an addictive, somehow selfish, personality (which Buffy once pointed out).[59] This was seen when Willow became addicted to magic, as it was then that she felt useful and needed, which slowly but surely spiraled out of control to the point where it even hurt her loved ones. Willow, however, had since claimed that she had grown up since then and was not that same \"little girl\" she was then, showing emotional maturity and growth. Willow also was stubborn in her beliefs and not easily swayed from them, shown in her insistence that the world needed magic and determination to bring it back to the world.[citation needed]\n\nHowever, on several occasions, Willow gave into fits of vengeance, especially if it involved someone she loved such as Oz or Tara. The incident with Tara made her personality, for a brief time, change drastically. She became consumed with pain, grief and anger, which culminated in lashing out at the Trio, who she believed was the cause of her suffering. Willow became cold and uncaring, with little regard for her friends and no remorse over her actions. She also showed deep self-loathing, stressing how she was mocked and ridiculed in her past years and how she was branded as a \"junkie\" for her addiction to magic. In spite of all these, Willow, at her worst, still acknowledged the love and appreciation she had received from Tara, who she could no longer be with. After gaining the power to feel the emotions of all the people of the world, she became hellbent on saving it from any more suffering by ending it herself. However, Willow returned to her former self thanks to Xander.[citation needed]\n\nSince returning from her brief trip to England to restore herself, Willow has become more reluctant to use her powers, as she was afraid to go dark once more. This reluctance to use magic became stronger when the First Evil worked through her while she was doing a locator spell. However, after restoring Angel's soul and defeating the \"The Beast's Master,\" she became a bit less apprehensive of her powers. When Willow was asked by Buffy to do one of the most powerful spells she'll do in her entire life, Willow was still lukewarm to the idea, even when Buffy acknowledged her as one of the strongest people she knew. However, when she did her preparations to center herself and cast the spell, she was overwhelmed with the good magic she could channel, even being deified by Kennedy. The spell changed the landscape for everyone and since then, Willow desired to delve deeper into the high witching arts, allowing her to become more powerful than she already is.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the point in her life when her powers were at its strongest, Willow has become more open to casting complex spells consecutively without worrying if the magic will corrupt her once again. Though there came a point when she went dark for a moment, it didn't do much to make her falter. She has since become more confident in her magic and her capacity to control her overwhelming power. Despite this newfound awareness of her strength, Willow remains as the person she always was. However, the moment magic was cut off on Earth, Willow burst out in a fit of anguish and despair, knowing that she does not have powers anymore. This point in her life showed a side of vulnerability and dependence that the witch did not normally show.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing the recent end of magic, Willow became obsessed with finding a way to bring it back; though it initially appeared that she simply wanted her powers back, she later revealed that, with the loss of the Seed, people were losing hope and that suicide rates are spiking all over the world; thus, her motivations to restore magic were to save the world and undo the damage caused by the Twilight crisis. Though she was not furious with Buffy for her part at the end of magic, she admitted to treating her best friend poorly. Since returning from her brief mission, Willow has learned to no longer fear her powers and reassured Buffy that if it weren't for everything that happened and for the choices that she made, she wouldn't have had such a realization. This was evident during the battle at the entrance to the Deeper Well in England, when Willow did not hesitate to unleash her full powers to destroy the opposition and cover Buffy.[citation needed]\n\nPerhaps, among all the members of the Scooby Gang, Willow was the one that has changed the most, not just in terms of her personality, but in all aspects of her being. She transitioned from a dainty young girl with an affinity for computers, research, and academics into, probably, the most powerful witch on Earth, and with such a transition comes changes that affect Willow and those close to her. Despite all these changes, Willow, in the deepest aspects of her being, remained as sweet, kind, and understanding as she had been. As an adult, Willow still had books on mathematics on her shelves despite the multitude of spellbooks surrounding it and working as a computer technician after the end of magic.[citation needed]\n\nWillow was a big fan of Elvis Presley.[43] Before her lesbian revelation, she had a fixation on the actor John Cusack.[136] According to Kennedy, she always turned off the Moulin Rouge DVD at chapter 32 so it had a happy ending.[63]",

This brings Legion directly in contact with Shepard, allowing the two to meet in person.\n\nLater, Legion asks for Shepard’s assistance in carrying out its mission: to stop the Reapers from overwriting the “true” geth and turning them all into “heretic” geth. Shepard either destroys the “heretics” for good, or else repurposes the virus to overwrite the “heretics” and turn them all into “true” geth. In either case, the viral threat is neutralized.\n\nLegion’s interactions with the Normandy crew, and with Shepard in particular, pave the way for the possibility of geth/quarian peace in ME3.\n\nSquadmate: Legion is a late-game squadmate in ME2.",

However, only up to 10  PT can be saved up in total. \n• The Max PT cannot be increased by any means nor can additional PT be gained outside of reaching a  milestone or accomplishing a goal below. \n• Perks purchased here are chain-wide in effect unless stated otherwise. \n\nReward Scenarios: \n• Monster Tamer (+1) \nJumpers have many options for recruiting non-human creatures. For every 5 non-human creatures you have  captured or befriended, whether they’ve become Followers, Pets or Companions, you get 1 Prize Token. \n• Drawback Taker (+1) \nDrawbacks are no fun, but why wouldn’t you take them for some extra cash? Well, as a reward for being a  good little Jumper you get 1 Prize Token for every 10 Drawbacks you have taken since the last milestone. \n• The Writer (+1) \nThis scenario is not visible to the Jumper, it is strictly Meta. \nFor every 5000 words you wrote since the last Milestone take one Prize Token. \n• Thousand Faces (+1) \nFor every 2 Alt-Forms you gain one Prize Token. \n• Exterminators (+2) \nThere are way too many assholes out there. For every four evil bastards you kill or have part in their death,  you get 2 PT from me, sound fair? \n• Jumper Fix-It (+2) \nMany settings are messed up in some way shape or form. Let’s make a deal, for every world you have saved, improved and not caused a crapton of suffering while doing so (No, killing the Imperium of Man and it’s  Emperor is not fixing 40k) you get 2 PT. If you’re uncertain what would work for this, ask yourself how  much suffering you’d be causing with your plan and how much less a plan that has more work to do, would  cause. If your plan is causing more than the least amount possible in suffering, then you screwed up. \n• Pack Rat (+2) \nJump-chan doesn’t like it when Jumpers have empty Warehouses and likes to parade their collections before  others of their kind while Jumper is gone. For every 5 items you have purchased since the last milestone you  get 2 PT from me. \n• Conqueror (+2) \nJumpers are powerful beings, that cannot be denied for them once they reach a certain age. Some like to use  that power to take control of places. For every territorial area (nation or world, depending on scale of  conquest) you gain 2 PT.",

      "title": "Companion Houserules",
      "body": "Existing Companions may be taken along into any jump without using the Import option simply by having them exit the Warehouse/housing area. Paying CP for the import option in a given Jump only guarantees that Companions have an in-world backstory and/or allows them to spend CP to improve themselves as specified in the individual jump document. '0 CP' imports are basically Drop-Ins without ID papers who don't get perks, items, or freebies. If a specific jump says that 0 CP imports do get such things, then they still get them in that jump.\n\nA 'generic' import option may be used for 50 CP per Companion, or a bulk rate of 200 CP to import up to 8 Companions. If a given Jump does specify different CP values or terms for a Companion import, then those options may be used instead at the Jumper's discretion.\n\nNo 'new recruit' Companion can cost more than 200 CP a head unless they are considered OP/game-breaker status by the standards of their native jump. This is intended to help redress point-balance problems from earlier jump docs before a community set of standards started to be informally adopted, please don't cheese it. If a specific Jump-doc (like Touhou) already lets you recruit an OP/game-breaker NPC for 200 CP or less, that still works.\n\nAny Companion imported via a 'paid CP' option, whether specific or generic, receives a minimum of 600 CP to spend. This particular proviso does supersede Jump-document specifics. If the Jump-document already specifies that they get more than 600 CP then use the higher amount.\n\nImported Companions receive all freebies and discounts appropriate to their Race, Origin, Background, etc., unless the specific Jump-document says otherwise. If a given Race, Origin, Background etc. would cost CP to take then the Companion must still spend that CP unless the specific Jump-document says otherwise.\n\nStasis Pods don't exist. The only thing necessary to recruit a Companion is to inform them of the Jumpchain and its opportunities and risks, and have them agree to come with you when the current jump ends. Jump-Chan will take it from there.\n\n     An 'emergency medevac' recruitment, where a would-be Companion is being yoinked into the Warehouse Medbay under fire at the end of a jump and is in no condition to hear the explanation or make decisions before jump-end, must be first brought to consciousness in the Warehouse and given a fair chance to hear and decide on the recruitment pitch before the next Jump is allowed to begin. Should the prospective recruit refuse to come along, Jump-Chan will give them a free trip home.\n\n     At the start of your Jumpchain, you have the option of making a Companion recruitment attempt for any friends or family. They still must come along willingly.\n\nThe Jumpchain is a metaphysical multiversal adventure of epic scope, and not to be taken lightly. Every Companion must accept that status of their own informed consent, or else Jump-Chan won't add them to your party. By Jump-Fiat things like charisma perks, Perfect Communication, etc., have a much lower effect, or no effect at all, during the Companion recruitment pitch. Deciding to come along on the Jump is the most important decision the Companion will ever make in their lives; its not polite to cheat.\n\nThe generic import option may also be used to find new OC Companions in-setting with CP budgets as per the above, whose personalities and nature are already aligned with the Jumper's expectations. OC companions are considered to be automatically successful recruitments.\n\nA 'new recruit' companion that is paid for with CP, if the option exists in a jump, is considered an automatically successful recruitment. The main purpose of spending CP is if a Companion would otherwise have no in-character reason to abandon their life and come with you, but you want them anyway.\n\nAt the end of every jump Companions may choose among the Ending options for themselves, separately from the Jumper. So if they want to go home or stay in a jump while the Jumper wants to go on, they can... but barring the Jumper's successful ascension or a use of the Warehouse Return option they will never see the Jumper again, and if they choose to remain in a jump not their native jump then barring a post-Spark Jumper returning to give them a lift they will never see their home jump again.",
